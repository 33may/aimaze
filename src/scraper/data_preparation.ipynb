    "# Data Preparation Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This document describes the preparation of data used to support the development and evaluation of algorithms for retrieving and labeling API documentation pages. The process includes collecting raw HTML documents, labeling relevant pages as endpoint-related, and storing all data in a structured format for later use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Collection Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "the data in our case consists of raw HTML pages from multiple API documentation websites. Based on the HTML documentâ€”referred to here as an **API page** we need to perform two tasks. To better understand the tasks, we introduce one more distinction: the set of **API pages** contains the **endpoint pages** (API pages that actually contain the endpoints that need to be implemented) and their complement **non-endpoint pages**, which we are not interested in. Note here that there are also non-endpoint pages that contain general information about the API, which might be required to properly generate the endpoints, but that will be covered later during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main tasks in the project are defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 1: Given the website link, parse the website and retrieve all API pages\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 2: Using the API pages generate the python code to interact with endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data preparation aims to make both these task easier during development by providing structured data infrastructure that will ensure more modular development and save time allowing to interact with application parts without need to rely on other parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benchmark Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "The website parsing requires not only saving the pages but also the good algorithm that will ensure all the endpoints are collected without too many additional irrelevant pages, for that we need to design the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the algorith design we decided to make the benchmark driven approach, where we construct the benchmark that after the run of parsing process with certain algorithm gives the result statistics. To make this benchmark we review API docs and labeled the Endpoint docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the list of APIs we constructed the labeled dataset, for each site we have created the binary classification labeling of the **Endpoint pages**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example object:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However the webparsing process is time-consuming and this is suboptimal to wait each time to evaluate algorithm, saving pages are also required for easier modular development of code generation. We created the database table for development. So such approach allows for both running the `scraper_benchmark` function to evaluate scraping algorithms way faster(comparison in the next section), and retrieving the all HTML **endpoint pages** to test the coder part of the project, without need to run the scraping, which might not be optimal and takes a lot of time. This will allow to develop the coder part from the start of the project with the assumption that optimal scraping logic is already developed.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This data preparation process provided a robust foundation for modular development, benchmarking, and experimentation across different components of the application. By separating concerns between data acquisition, labeling, and downstream usage, we achieved several key benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reusability and Modularity**: Once pages are scraped and stored, they can be reused across multiple phasesâ€”benchmarking, endpoint classification, and code generationâ€”without re-crawling the source websites. This allows developers to work independently on different parts of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Benchmarking Support**: The labeled dataset of known endpoint pages enables objective evaluation of different crawling strategies. By comparing parsed output against the benchmark, we can iteratively improve scraping algorithms with measurable feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Experimentation**: The database acts as a local mirror of the documentation sites. This allows for rapid testing of filters, heuristics, and extraction techniques without repeated network requests, significantly speeding up development.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Seamless Integration for Code Generation**: With endpoint pages readily available in the database, the code generation module can be developed and tested independently of the scraper. This decouples the system and ensures that early work on code generation is not blocked by scraping performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Controlled Environment for Iteration**: The data pipeline enables deterministic runs with consistent input, which is crucial for debugging, regression testing, and ensuring reproducibility in research and production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, this data preparation step transforms an inherently messy and variable processâ€”web crawling and API documentation analysisâ€”into a structured, testable, and iterative workflow. It enables the project to be developed as a pipeline of loosely coupled modules, each of which can be tested, benchmarked, and improved in isolation.\n"
